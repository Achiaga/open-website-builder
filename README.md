## Antfolio

This project is a website builder. The pros are the freedom you have to create while mainting simplicity (easy-to-use).

It started out as a side project but now it has become an open-source with a non-profit purpose. (Right now unmaintained)

The project pivoted from a resume builder (to help candidates outstand from the crowd by offering a more visual resume that would encourage recruiters to read it) to a website builder online for any kind of purpose like a personal (portfolio) website, a website to sell your online products or to attract people to your gumroad, an event/party/invitation website, wedding invitations, etc. 

It is still a wip but it has already reached the MVP.
